## PhotoSynthesis
### Photosynthesis and Pigments
- involved in every food chain
  - most of carbon were involved. 
  - Oxygen is a by-product
- solar energy to biochemical energy: 6 CO2 + 12H2O to C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O
- Respiration
  - in mitochondria (stoed energy to ATP with O2)
  - All organism must extract energy from food through respiration
  - Photosynthesis and respiration are **independent** processes
  - ATP(**Adenosien triphosphate**) energy currency, required by every living cells. 
  - Ultimately, all organisms are solar-powered
- Active Light
  - 40% energy recived on earth: visible light
  - leaves absorb 80% of visible light reaching them
  - light is absorbed by **pigments**, different pigments - different wavelengths
  - pigment color determined by **reflected light**, or light NOT absorbed
