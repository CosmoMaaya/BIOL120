### Secondary Growth (Vascular cambium) in shoots
* An increaset in **girth** generated by cell divisions of **lateral meristems**
* observed in **stems** and **roots** of woody plants
* All gymnosperms, some perennial tree and shrub angiosperms (20% of dicots and 5% of monocots)
* **Lateral meristems** form in regions of maturation in stems and roots that have completed growing in length
* Cylindrical and **radial expansion**
* Why needed?
  * Most angiosperms do not have or need secondary growth.
  * Annual plants -> NO
  * increase conduciton and support
  * replace old tissues so do not have to maintain over hundreds of years
* Secondary xylem and phloem
  * **Xylem**: water conducting tissue 'root to shoot.
  * **Phloem**: metabolite conducting tissue 'shoot to root'
  * function the same as primary
  * secondary xylem tends to have **thicker walls** due to increase in **lignin** content
  * lignin 2nd most common organic compound on Earth
* Wood = secondary xylem
  * largely of dead cells, tracheids or vessel members
  * highly lignified
  * only the more recently formed layers of secondary xylem conduct water and minerals.
  * primary and older secondary xylem become inactive
    * Dicots form **hardwood**: xylem are made of fibers and vessels (hard, more lgnin)
    * Conifer form **softwood**: xylem consists primarily of tracheids (softer, less lignin)
* Secondary phloem
  * only more recent layers of living secondary phloem conduct photosynthetic products
  * promary and older secondary phloem become stretched and broken as vascular cambium push them outward (bark)
* Growth patterns (ring)/dendrochronology
  * size of cells varies with season: small in later summer (**summerwood**/late wood), large in the spring (**spring wood**/early wood)
  * stress = less growth
  * **Heartwood**: older, non-conducting rings of xylem in the center of the trunk or root. Usually darker
  * **Sapwood**: outer xylem rings that still conduct water and minerals.
  * **Antibacterial** and **antimicrobial** compounds are produced by parenchyma
    * Antimicrobials: Resin
      * **Pine** and **nonflowering** plants.

    * **Auxin hormone** signals the formation of vascular cambium from (in dicot and conifer stems):
      * **Fusiform initials**: cells derived from residual procambium cells located between primary xylem and phloem
      * **Ray Initials**: arise from parenchyma cells or cortex (ground tissue) between vascular bundles
  * Cork cambium (Phellogen)
    * Two types of dermal tissu: **epidermis** and **periderm**
    * During secondary growth, **cork cambium** (phellogen) replaces epidermis and cortex with **periderm** (cork, cork cambium, phelloderm)
    * **cork(phellem)**: forms to the outside of the cork cambium. Consists of dead cells when mature
    * **phelloderm**: forms to inside and consists of thin layer of living parenchyma cells
    * Expansion of cortex causes cortex to break apart and fall off stem. 
    * Subsequent cork cambia arise from secondary phloem to the inside
  * Bark = **Periderm**
    * consists of all tissues external to the vascular cambium
      * **Inner bark**
        * living secondary phloem, vascular cambium, inner most cork cambium and any remaining cortex
        * **carries sugar** and other organic molecules
      * **Outer bark**
        * dead tissue (includes dead secondary phloem, all layers of periderm outside of most recent cork cambium)
        * provides protection from abiotic and biotic stress
    * Bark is typically thinner than the woody portion of stem. Essential for tree viability
    * Pattern variable but characteristic for different species
    * Bark = protection
      * preventing water loss and infection by pathogenic organisms and predation 
      * cork cambium cannot grow in diameter, must reform inside the old one (toward a source of water and nutrients)
      * cork cells enlarge and become impregnated with **suberin**
    * **Suberin**
      * a complex polyester bioplymer that is lipophilic
      * in stems and roots, barrier of water and solutes.
      * make cork cells water proof
      * nothing gets in, nothing gets out
    * Gas Exchange
      * **lenticels** are small openings in outer bark of stems and roots that allow gas exchange in tissue blocked by suberin coated cork cells
  * Antimicrobials
    * **Resin**
  * **Dedifferentiate**
    * From derivative cell
    * can be observed in vegetative propagation (asexual reproduction)
  * More secondary xylem is produced than phloem. Phloem produced before xylem.

* Monocot: no vascular cambium, no true secondary growth. Only thicking of ground tissue, no annaul growth rings.

#### Primary and Secondary Growth
##### Root primary growth
  * **Region of Cell Division(Root Apical Meristem, RAM)**: in the center of root tip

  * **Cork cambium**:
    * Cork (phellem), cork cambium, Phelloderm
    * forms from dedifferentiated parenchyma cortex, then secondary phloem.

* **Additional support**: **Buttress roots** extend from the base of tree trunk to help stabilize tree in shallow soil; common in tropical trees.
* **Parasitism**: **Parasitic roots (dobbers)**
  * have no chlorophyll and dependent on chlorophyll-bearing plants for nutrition.
  * Use peg-like projections (**haustoria**) to tap into vascular system of host plant.
  * Parasitic as NOT beneficial to host

### Water Transport
#### Transport Pathways and Cohesion Tension theory
##### Pathways
* **Apoplastic** transport (dead space):
  * outside of the plasma membrane: through permeable cellulose **cell wall** and **middle lamellae**
  * movement through **permeable** cell walls
* **Symplastic** transport (living space):
  * "cytoplasmic continuum" between cells, does not cross plasma membrane: through **cytoplasm** and **plasmodesmata**
  * Plasmodesmata （胞间连丝）
    * water and dissolved substances can pass through
    * **Size exclusion** limits
    * Do not have to pass through semi-permeable plasma membrane
  * must pass through **semi-permeable** barrier
* **Transmembrane** Transport (living space):
  * Movement through semi-permeable plasma membranes: through **cytoplasm**, **plasma membrane** and **cell wall**
  * plasma membranes are semi-permeable barriers
    * Diffusion
    * Facilitated diffusion: transport proteins
    * Acitve transport: transport proteins and ATP
    * Endocytosis and exosytosis
    * Osmosis（渗透）: solute concentraton
  * must pass **size-exclusion** limit
* **Casparian strips** (cell wall and midlle lamella reinforced with **suberin** and **lignin**): 
  * block apoplastic pathway.
  * in exo- and endodermis
  * plasmodesmata on front and back of endermal cells facilitate transport into pericycle
  * water and solutes enter xylem from pericycle via apoplastic pathway; tracheids and/or vessel members are dead at maturity thus no membrane
  * additional **lignified, secondary walls** to further restrict apoplastic transport
  * **passage cells**: not secondary wall thickening or casparian strips, allow unrestricted transport at the front and back of cell
##### Transport in vascular cylinder
* **Sap**
  * the fluid transported in xylem (tracheids and vessel members) or phloem (sieve tube elements)
  * made up water, nutrients and sugars
  * maple syrup: xylem samp, moving up from storage roots in the spring

| Tracheids | Vessel Members | 
| --- | --- |
| vascular plants | angiosperms |
| narrow (2-10 um) and tapered | Wide (100); short units but can be meters long when stacked into column. transport 100x more water than tracheids |
|staggered stacking|stacked on top of on another to form "pipes" |
| closed off and tapered at ends | Perforation plates or open ended at top and bottom, continuous water flow|
| > |Dead at maturity, thick lignified secondary walls. Provide structural support. Pits on side of vessels allow lateral water and solute flow |

* **Tracheids**: vascular plants
  * movement is restricted between pits since closed on the end
  * pits:
    * **simple pits**: pore formed from absence of secondary wall, primary wall only barrier
    * **Bodered pits**: have secondary wall extending over opening and a torus that functions like a hydraulic valve
    * **torus** helps block movement of gases and pathogenic microorganism
##### Cohesion-Tension theory
* explain water transport in they xylem
* **Adhesion**: attraction between different kinds of molecules (most important): water adher to cellulose walls of xylem tracheids and vessels, forming water column
* **Cohesion**: attraction between molecules of the same kind: water are ploar and bind to each other (hydrogen bonds), further supports water column
* **Tension**: negative pression on water or solutions which draws water upward, crated by transpiration（蒸腾作用）
* Cavitation （空化）:
  * Tracheids and vessel elements have thick, lignified secondary wall to withstand tension generated from negative pressire
  * greater tension increases the risk of breakage of water column; trunks of trees can contract from tension like a straw
  * Formation of air bublles or ice crystals known as **embolism** can break the water column
  * Breakage occurs less in tracheids than vessle elements because of their anatomical difference
    * water less supported by vessle member walls: wider, air bubble easier
    * Embolisms form separately in each tracheid; have to move through pits, lateral flow
    * In vessel members, entire column fills with air or ice when cavitation occurs
  * Embolisms block water flow: from when flower stems are cut => remove by cutting of the lower 3cm of the stem, underwater
#### Osmosis and Water potential
* Principles of water movement: controlled by three processes
##### Bulk flow 
* molecules of water move in mass from one place to another in response to differences in potential energy
##### diffusion
* the spontaneous movement of water down a concentration gradient
##### Osmosis
* movement of water or any solvent across a selectively permeable membrane
* across plasma membrane facilitated by **aquaporins**
* spontaneously from lower solute concentration (higher water concentration) to high (low)
* **Hypotonic solutions**: the solution surrouding the cells has a lower concentration of solutes
  * water into cell, cell wall prevents cell rupture, ideal condition for plant
* **Isotonic solutions**: same concentration: (dynamic) euquilibrium but the cell is NOT turgid
* **Hypertonic solutions**: higher
  * water out, plasma membrane shrinks (**plasmolysis**), symplastic transport impaired. Unusual to see in nature, typically in laboratory settings
* **Water potential**
  * measure ment that predicts which way water will flow between a plant cell and its surroundings or between different parts of the plant (root/shoot)
  * $$\Psi_w = \Psi_\pi + \Psi_p$$
    * $\Psi_\pi = \text{osmotic potential}$
      * always -ve
    * $\Psi_p = \text{pressure potential (turgor pressure)}$ 
      * based on mechanical pressure
      * as water enters vacuole, pressure against wall (it) increases
      * always +ve
    * most living cells: 0 or -ve (hypotonic)
  * Relative water potential
    * determining direction of flow
    * more and more -ve as water moves up from soil to leaves

#### Transpiration
* release of water vapour into the air from aerial organs
* functions:
  * cools leaves heated by sunlight
  * pulls water and water-soluble minerlas up from teh roots
* tree: 700-3500 liters of water/day, corn: 2L/day
* **Stomata**:
  * 90% transpiration occurs through
  * occurs at highest density on the underside of leaves
  * \> 1% of the leaf surface area
  * can be found on all aerial (above ground) organs
  * controlled through turgor pressure of guard cells
    * Open: turgid guard cells, K+ enter and water follows
    * Close: Flaccid guard cells: K+ exit and water follows
  * Signal varies: water status, CO2 levels, light intensity, humidity, temperature and hormones
* **Lenticels**
  * pores, cannot open/close
  * aren't as high up in water column (stems/trunks) as leaves, only account for 0.1% of overall transpiration in a plant
  * In fruits (apple, mango, pear and avocado), lenticels form from stomata => can account for 20$ of overall transpiration in plant
  * allows very little water loss (5%)
  * reduce water loss (in arid env) by:
    * Thicker cuticles
    * Mesophyll packed closer together, no air soaces
    * sunken stomates to reduce evaporation
    * increased layers of epidermis
    * only open stomata at night
### Vascular

* Xylem: transports water and nutrients from the roots to stems and leaves. Complex tissue that can be made of the following:
  * **Parenchyma** (ALIVE at maturity)
  * **Sclerenchyma** (DEAD)
  * **Vessel members** (angiosperm): DEAD, short and have perforation plates and pits
  * **Tracheids** (ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperm): DEAD, have pits but not perforation plates
* Phloem: Distributes products of photosynthesis to rest of plant
  * **Parenchyma**
  * **Sieve Tube Members and Companion Cells**: Tube are ALIVE but lack nucleus and are assoiciated with companion cells to form **Sieve Tube Element**. Sieve tube memebrs have **sieve plates** on either end.
* Cambium
  * Layer of dividing cells between xylem and phloem responsible for the secondary growth of stems and roots.
