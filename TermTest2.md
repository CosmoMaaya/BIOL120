### Dermal
  #### Periderms and epidermis
### Ground
#### Bulk of plant body, tissues that are not dermal or vascular
* Photosynthesis, storage and support
* **cortex**: between dermal and vscular tissues
* **pith**: in vascular cylinder
1. **Parenchyma**: general purpose cells of the plant, alive at maturity
    * most common and least specialized
    * **Where**: majority of ground tissue in leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits
    * **Appearance**: Polyhedral, large, thin and primary walls, highly vacuolated(bubbles)
    * **Funtion**: photosynthesis, storage, structure and transportation
    * Also vascular tissue
2. **Collenchyma**: Provide flexible support, alive at maturity
   * **Where**: leaves, petioles and stems but rarely in roots
   * **Apperance**: 
     * unevenly (irregular) thick primary walls (lack secondary walls)

### Primary growth in shoots and roots
* increase of **length** by cellular division of the apical meristem
* meristems present in ALL plants (mosses to seed plants)
* **SAM/RAM**: length. Stem outwards in **axillary buds**, roots branch with **lateral roots** (pericycle).
* **initials**: cells of meristem. totipotent. mitosis to daughter cells, differentiation to derivative cells (or go back to initial?)
* **SAM**: 
  * stem, leaves and flowers. 
  * dividing cells are small, dense with sytoplasm. Mature, differentiated cells are larger and highly vacuolated.
* **LAB5: overwintering**:
  * *Bundle scars* mar the vascular (conduction) tissue with leaf scars
  * *Deciduous* trees and shrubs lose all leaves annually. After leaves fall, have dormant axillary buds with leaf scars below.
* **RAM**:
  * resides in quiescent center of root tip 
  * each lateral root has their own RAM

### Secondary Growth (Vascular cambium) in shoots
* An increaset in **girth** generated by cell divisions of **lateral meristems**
* observed in **stems** and **roots** of woody plants
* All gymnosperms, some perennial tree and shrub angiosperms (20% of dicots and 5% of monocots)
* **Lateral meristems** form in regions of maturation in stems and roots that have completed growing in length
* Cylindrical and **radial expansion**
* Why needed?
  * Most angiosperms do not have or need secondary growth.
  * Annual plants -> NO
  * increase conduciton and support
  * replace old tissues so do not have to maintain over hundreds of years
* Secondary xylem and phloem
  * **Xylem**: water conducting tissue 'root to shoot.
  * **Phloem**: metabolite conducting tissue 'shoot to root'
  * function the same as primary
  * secondary xylem tends to have **thicker walls** due to increase in **lignin** content
  * lignin 2nd most common organic compound on Earth
* Wood = secondary xylem
  * largely of dead cells, tracheids or vessel members
  * highly lignified
  * only the more recently formed layers of secondary xylem conduct water and minerals.
  * primary and older secondary xylem become inactive
    * Dicots form **hardwood**: xylem are made of fibers and vessels (hard, more lgnin)
    * Conifer form **softwood**: xylem consists primarily of tracheids (softer, less lignin)
* Secondary phloem
  * only more recent layers of living secondary phloem conduct photosynthetic products
  * promary and older secondary phloem become stretched and broken as vascular cambium push them outward (bark)
* Growth patterns (ring)/dendrochronology
  * size of cells varies with season: small in later summer (**summerwood**/late wood), large in the spring (**spring wood**/early wood)
  * stress = less growth
  * **Heartwood**: older, non-conducting rings of xylem in the center of the trunk or root. Usually darker
  * **Sapwood**: outer xylem rings that still conduct water and minerals.
  * **Antibacterial** and **antimicrobial** compounds are produced by parenchyma
    * Antimicrobials: Resin
      * **Pine** and **nonflowering** plants. 
      * Flow through **resin canals** in secondary xylem and phloem, periderm and leaves.
    * Latex
      * **10 % of flowering** plants produce **latex**(乳胶)
      * blocks entry of pathogens, contains compounds with growth inhibitory properties
      * deter insect and animal predators
      * produced in vessel or special cells called **laticifers**, network not as visible as resin canals
      * close to surface, released upon injury
* Lateral Meristems (**Cambium**)
  * Vascular cambium
    * secondary xylem (wood) & secondary phloem (bark)
    * Forms from dedifferentiated cortex and procambium
    * produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem in between primary xylem and primary phloem
    * **Auxin hormone** signals the formation of vascular cambium from (in dicot and conifer stems):
      * **Fusiform initials**: cells derived from residual procambium cells located between primary xylem and phloem
      * **Ray Initials**: arise from parenchyma cells or cortex (ground tissue) between vascular bundles
  * Cork cambium (Phellogen)
    * Two types of dermal tissu: **epidermis** and **periderm**
    * During secondary growth, **cork cambium** (phellogen) replaces epidermis and cortex with **periderm** (cork, cork cambium, phelloderm)
    * **cork(phellem)**: forms to the outside of the cork cambium. Consists of dead cells when mature
    * **phelloderm**: forms to inside and consists of thin layer of living parenchyma cells
    * Expansion of cortex causes cortex to break apart and fall off stem. 
    * Subsequent cork cambia arise from secondary phloem to the inside
  * Bark = **Periderm**
    * consists of all tissues external to the vascular cambium
      * **Inner bark**
        * living secondary phloem, vascular cambium, inner most cork cambium and any remaining cortex
        * **carries sugar** and other organic molecules
      * **Outer bark**
        * dead tissue (includes dead secondary phloem, all layers of periderm outside of most recent cork cambium)
        * provides protection from abiotic and biotic stress
    * Bark is typically thinner than the woody portion of stem. Essential for tree viability
    * Pattern variable but characteristic for different species
    * Bark = protection
      * preventing water loss and infection by pathogenic organisms and predation 
      * cork cambium cannot grow in diameter, must reform inside the old one (toward a source of water and nutrients)
      * cork cells enlarge and become impregnated with **suberin**
    * **Suberin**
      * a complex polyester bioplymer that is lipophilic
      * in stems and roots, barrier of water and solutes.
      * make cork cells water proof
      * nothing gets in, nothing gets out
    * Gas Exchange
      * **lenticels** are small openings in outer bark of stems and roots that allow gas exchange in tissue blocked by suberin coated cork cells
  * Antimicrobials
    * **Resin**
  * **Dedifferentiate**
    * From derivative cell
    * can be observed in vegetative propagation (asexual reproduction)
  * More secondary xylem is produced than phloem. Phloem produced before xylem.

* Monocot: no vascular cambium, no true secondary growth. Only thicking of ground tissue, no annaul growth rings.

  * abscission zone near base of petiole
  1. Protective layer of cells coated and impregnated with suberin to seal off leaf scar
  2. Separation layer of pectins in the middle lamella are broken down by enzymes, at petiole and stem border
* Internal structures
  * **Epidermal tissue**: protection and gas exchange
    * Devoid of chloroplasts
    * Coated with **Cuticle** and **Surface waxes** provide protection from water loss, light irradiation and pathogen attack
    * The surface waxes also serve as a semi-permeable barrier and regulate gas exchange and evaporation of water
    * **Trichome hairs** control moisture loss and predation
      * uni- or multi cellular outgrowths of the epidermis
      * primary function is **plant defence**, particularly against insects
      * can be simple physical barriers and deterrents to insect movement OR can be glands secreting essential oils
        * **Essential oils**: prevent predation (taste) and act as insect repellant and antimicrobials. -- scent
    * Waste materials may accumulate in peridermal cells
    * **Stomata** for gas exchange:
      * lower epidermis cutin perforated by
      * regualte **gas exchange** between leaf interior and atmosphere

  * **Mesophyll**: photosynthesis
    * **Palisade mesophyll**
      * elongated cells, below upper epidermis, tightly packed
    * **Spongy mesophyll**
      * below, loosely pack, air spaces to allow CO2 diffusion
    * Both involved in photosynthesis, contain chloroplasts
    * Monocot do not have differentiated palisade and spongy layers.
      * often have **bulliform** cells flanking the central vein, partly collapse under dry conditions, causing leaf to fold and reducing transpiration.
    * **Vascular tissue**: form veins to transport organic molecules, water and minerals between leaves and the rest of the plant.
* Specialized leaves
  * **Succulent**: (water) storage
    * parenchyma cells with large vacuoles for water storage
    * often found in desert(arid) plants
    * leaves appear swollen and have shiny appearance due to thick waxy cuticle
  * **Spines**: Defence
    * reduce leaf surface and water loss, protect from herbivory
    * **NOT** spelized leaves
      * **Throns**: modified stems arising from leaf axils
      * **Prickles**: outgrowths from epidermis or cortex
  * **Floral leaves**: Bracts
    * bases of flowers or flower stalks, **Poinsettia** and **Clary's sage**
  * Nutrients and Reproduction: **Flower-pot leaves**
